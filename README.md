# responsiveportfolio 

Responsive Portfolio built with Boostrap's grid system (containers, rows, and columns). <br> 
I recreated 3 pages: index.html, portfolio.html and contact.html.<br> All pages were developed to be seen in screens with diferent sizes, including very small screens.<br>
In the portfolio page I added some personal shots and they were all positioned  using the grid system. In each image, I added a carousel caption.


**Key words**: 
    *Boostrap*,
    *Grid System*,
    *Containers*,
    *Rows*,
    *Columns*,
    *Caroussel*,
    *Nav bar*.

Below are some screenshots on how the website it's going to look:
